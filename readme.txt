# How to run the code
1. 'cd' to the folder contains file 'plummer.cpp'.
2. type 'make' in terminal. If you get compiled, you will get the excutable file 'plummer'
3. type './plummer'

#configuration the program
There's a configuration file 'config.txt'. Open it, I think you know everthing. Just change the value on the right side of the '=', save it, and run the code by typing './plummer' again(Don't need to compile it again).

#I have updated the integration to second order symplectic method. const Ampletude can be guaranteed (no numerical dissapation). 

#note: if you cannot get compiled. update the compiler to support c++17.

Good luck!
